This allow efficient scaling of the here presented workflow for this adaptation of the TU Wien Bayesian flood mapping algorithm. The data size will be a main limiting factor as the data grows larger than RAM. For this reason we will partition our data in chunks which will presented to the machine workers by Dasks task scheduler in a most efficient manner. Although many of Dask' settings can be handled automatically, we can also modify some parameters for optimal performance of the workflow for the desired processing environment.

    "Having calculated the likelihoods, we can now move on to calculate the probability of (non-)flooding given a pixel's $\\sigma^0$. These so-called *posteriors* need one more piece of information, as can be seen in the equation above. We need the probability that a pixel is flooded $P(F)$ or not flooded $P(NF)$. Of course, these are the figures we've been trying to find this whole time. We don't actually have them yet, so what can we do? In Bayesian statistics, we can just start with our best guess. These guesses are called our \"priors\", because they are the beliefs we hold *prior* to looking at the data. This subjective prior belief is the foundation Bayesian statistics, and we use the likelihoods we just calculated to update our belief in this particular hypothesis. This updated belief is called the \"posterior\".\n",

    "The following step is designed to further improve the clarity of the floodmaps. These filters do not directly relate to prior knowledge on backscattering, but consists of contextual evidence that supports, or oppose, a flood classification. This mainly targets so-called speckles. These speckles are areas of one or a few pixels, and which are likely the result of the diversity of scattering surfaces at a sub-pixel level. In this approach it is argued that small, solitary flood surfaces are unlikely. Hence speckles are removed by applying a smoothing filter which consists of a rolling window median along the x and y-axis simultaneously.\n"
